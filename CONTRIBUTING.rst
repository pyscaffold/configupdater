Contributing
============

ConfigUpdater is an open-source project and needs your help to improve.
If you experience bugs or in general issues, please file an
issue report on our `issue tracker`_. If you also want to contribute code
or improve the documentation it's best to create a Pull Request (PR) on
Github. Here is a short introduction how it works.


Code Contributions
==================

Submit an issue
---------------

Before you work on any non-trivial code contribution it's best to first create
an issue report to start a discussion on the subject. This often provides
additional considerations and avoids unnecessary work.

Create an environment
---------------------

Before you start coding we recommend to install Miniconda_ which allows
to setup a dedicated development environment named ``configupdater`` with::

   conda create -n configupdater python=3 virtualenv pytest pytest-cov

Then activate the environment ``configupdater`` with::

   source activate configupdater

Clone the repository
--------------------

#. `Create a Gitub account`_  if you do not already have one.
#. Fork the `project repository`_: click on the *Fork* button near the top of the
   page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.
#. Clone this copy to your local disk::

    git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/configupdater.git

#. Run ``python setup.py develop`` to install ``configupdater`` into your environment.

#. Install ``pre-commit``::

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install

   PyScaffold project comes with a lot of hooks configured to
   automatically help the developer to check the code being written.

#. Create a branch to hold your changes::

    git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes. Never work on the master branch!

#. Start your work on this branch. When youâ€™re done editing, do::

    git add modified_files
    git commit

   to record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with::

    git push -u origin my-feature

#. Please check that your changes don't break any unit tests with::

    python setup.py test

   Don't forget to also add unit tests in case your contribution
   adds an additional feature and is not just a bugfix.

#. Use `flake8`_ to check your code style.
#. Add yourself to the list of contributors in ``AUTHORS.rst``.
#. Go to the web page of your ConfigUpdater fork, and click
   "Create pull request" to send your changes to the maintainers for review.
